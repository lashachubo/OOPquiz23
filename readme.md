# Quiz #2 - Java Lists

## Description

This Java program creates a new list (`list3`) from two existing lists:

- `list1`: A list of integers
- `list2`: A list of strings
- `list3`: The result list generated using a formula on `list1`

## Formula

To generate each value in `list3`, the program uses:
index = list1[i] x 2 - 1 [note: this is supposed to be times 2 but its not letting me type "*" without adding "\" behind it]
list3[i] = list2[index]
